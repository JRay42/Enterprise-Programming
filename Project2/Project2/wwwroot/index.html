        <p>
            <b>My name is Jordan Ray</b>, and I am post graduate, studying Computer Science at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uco.edu/">University of Central Oklahoma</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>I am inquisitive and love problem solving.</b> Whether it be finding the most efficient way to write a line of code or learning a creative method for extracting new information from legacy data, I enjoy the task of finding a way and realizing solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b> I began my education in the field of Geology,</b> first studying at Baylor University then later attaining a Master of Science degree in Geological Sciences from <a target="_blank" href="https://go.okstate.edu/undergraduate-academics/majors/geology.html">Oklahoma State University</a>
            . Following my studies, I spent some time at Chesapeake Energy, creating formation models using legacy and modern well data, 3D seismic surveys, and innovative equations for calculating formation pressure, all to produce new insight into the economic potential for my study area.
            My first week at Chesapeake, I spent “picking” formation tops on over 10,000 wells, a task that could easily cut the time by more than half with a well-trained Machine Learning algorithm. Daily we worked with extremely large, unorganized data sets, and it became apparent
            there was a need for innovative programming that would help quickly sort and mine through these large data sets.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>It was not until working for Baker Hughes,</b> an oil and gas service company, that I fully realized the liberty programming can provide. The program our team used often slowed down our progress in producing good, accurate results for our clients; it sadly left a large margin for errors.
            The long, tiring hours of checking over the accuracy of my reports, coupled with a constant demand of strict quality control and faster, more efficient work, propelled me to examine our company’s software and teach myself how to improve it, if only to make my daily processes easier and
            eliminate commonly overlooked mistakes from our team.

        </p>
        <p>
            <b>I began testing and tinkering with tools, rules, and templates.</b> This is where I learned that I could write and redesign our program to improve workflows and save time and resources for the entire team. The first time I made a successful change, I was ecstatic. This immediately gave me the
            motivation to pursue and build a fix for all the software and efficiency problems my colleagues and I could think of, which I worked on non-stop for the next three months. Through this work, I hoped my entire team would benefit from the program improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>After leaving Baker Hughes,</b> I knew that I wanted to pursue a Master of Science in Computer Science with a Machine Learning focus. To attain this goal, I began taking classes at the University of Central Oklahoma (UCO), where I currently strive to maintain a high standard of excellence in my
            coursework and to soak in everything there is to know. I made the Dean’s List last fall and am a member of UCO’s Computer Science Club as well as the High-Performance Computing Special Interest Group, where “the traveling salesman problem” was the most recent topic of conversation. I am a
            fast learner who enjoys logical problem-solving and thinking outside of the box. I enjoy tinkering and taking things apart to figure out how something works, then putting it back together.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Working in both small and giant companies</b> has shown me that we are still not at the peak of progress. There are more improvements that computer scientists can achieve. I expect the pursuit of this degree will propel me to create tools that improve the organization of data, as well as to
            develop projects (including text recognition and data management) using the data Uncle B left to me after his recent passing. I believe that with the help of UC Berkeley, I can become a successful Data Scientist who challenges growth in the world.
