# Expectations for the Semester 
I hope to get a better understanding of using GIT Hub for managing projects, managing, and accessing databases, web forms, and other industry tools. If able, having some exposure to SQL would also be great, as it is a skill that I have not been able to be exposed to yet. Besides that, I would like to just learn more about programmind and how it is used in an enterprise setting.
